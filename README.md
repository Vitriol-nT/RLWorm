# Building Action Agent with Reinforcement Learning from Scratch

Hello. This probably is going to be my biggest project ever.
It will involve techniques of Reinforcement learnings.
I think applying deep Q-learning would be suitable.

Finish might be overly delayed because of my Exams.

## 1. Utilization
It's primitive now.
In order to use, run app.py and run it on your local host.
For your control, you will use W-A-S-D keys.
If you're keyboard was switched to another language, it wouldn't work.
For example, if your keyboard is set to be Korean, resulting 'WASD' to be 'ㅈㅁㄴㅇ',
it wouldn't be able to read your controls.

## 2. Structure
**A1.py**: Agent1 is driven by set of mechanical principles. Without any form of intelligence.
It seeks the closest food it has from the head, and works in very structed forms, which may show limitations
on flexibility or reaching the high scores. Avoids walls, 

**A2.py**: Agent2 is DL model. (not yet made)

## 3. Comments
**1.** It responds to user input. As player input increases, the pre-recorded move of AI will be represented in corresponding place in the movement array.

**2.** The game will start as soon as you start giving the application a input.
